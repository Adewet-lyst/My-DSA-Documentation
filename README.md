My data analysis journey.

I have learnt quite a number of things, ranging from Microsoft Excel, SQL and Power Bi. It has been so insightful and i was able to derive a better understanding of why data is important in decision making in every organisation.

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to analyse products and customers review to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customers engagement. So, nalysing these parameters in the data will help gather adequate information to make appropriate decisions.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
 1. For data cleaning.
 2. For data manipulation.
- Excel Pivot table: For quick summarization of customer ratings, product category count.
- Excel Pivot Chart: For column chart, pie chart, Line chart to summarize and visualize key metrics to support quick insight for exploratory data analysis.
- Excel Dashboard: Designed to present clear view of product performance and sentiment.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, i performed the following functions:
 - Data loading and Inspection.
 - Filtering irrelevant entries and duplicates in the product and category column to reduce the number of character and to make them unique.
 - Removing irrelevant columns that do not support the analysis.
 - Text cleaning: I remove special character and use functions like TRIM, PROPER, to remove excess space and to convert text to proper case.
 - i created new columns to support and give bases to the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involved exploring the data to answer some questions such as:
- What is the average discount percentage by product category?
- How many product are listed under each category?
- What is the total number of review per category?
- What is the Average actual price versus the discounted price by category?
- What is the distribution of product rating?
- What is the total potential revenue?
- Top 5 product in terms of rating and number of reviews.
